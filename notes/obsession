                        BE OBSESSED OR BE AVERAGE (Audiobook)

- Realize that you have the capacity to be obsessed, because without the
  capacity of being obsessed you can not be great.

- Obsession means you have the juice, the fuel, the desire, the seed,
  the gift that can help you succeed in whatever it is you're obsessed with.

- Your obsession will get you out of the culture of average that is drowning 
  society.

- Give yourself the right to become selfish...with your dreams and your goals.

- Give youself the permission to be obsessed with your obsessions. Its all about
  desires, its all about seeing your desires all the way through despite the
  obstacles, despite the barriers, despite limitations, despite economic
  problems, despite competition.
