// Embedded devices without hardware clock
- Usually ntpd should be enabled using rcctl
    since most embedded do not have a hardware clock.

    If the time seems weird or inaccurate, you can do 
    two things:
        1) Set the correct location first:
           'ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/[Country] /etc/localtime'
        2) Update ntpd immediately: 'ntpd -vs'
        3) rdate -v pool.ntp.org
