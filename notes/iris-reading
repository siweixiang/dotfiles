Reading text-books
------------------
1) Preview the entire book. Figure out its structure.
   Read intro and summary of each chapter.

   Process of preview:
    - Read introduction, objectives & outline
    - Read conclusion & objectives/ questions
    - Take notes 

2) Overview
    - Read headings, sub-headings, bold-faced words & first 
    sentences of every paragraphs
    - Take notes

3) Read
    - Read section by section
    - Take notes after reading each section


- When taking notes, try to use a mindmap to organize your notes
- Avoid re-reading a sentence that you don't understand, try 
  finishing the entire paragraph first to get a better understanding.
  If you still dont get it then it is advisable to re-read.

4) Final Review:
  Sort of like re-reading, but focusing specifically on things 
  that you don't have a clear understanding of subject matter
