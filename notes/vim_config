1) To change c++ versions make sure you edit ~/.ycm_extra_conf.py 
and change this line to '-std=c++11'
2) Also run ./install.py --clang-completer --system-libclang    
(Note that in #2 --system-libclang is only necessary 
when you run into problems with YCM) 

// Compiling manually
If you are compiling manually from commandline make sure you pass 
'-std=c++11' as commandline argument to the g++ compiler
