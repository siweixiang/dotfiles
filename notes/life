These are my personal views based on practical experience / observations
========================================================================

- Drink plenty of water, make it a habit so that you drink unconsciously if you
  are drinking less than the required amount

- Coffee is not a replacement for water, just because you drank coffee doesn't
  mean you should not drink adequate water that is necessary on a daily basis

- Eat breakfast especially with a moderate percentage of carbohydrate like 
  bread/biscuits before taking your morning coffee to reduce the effect of crash
  (due to drinking coffee) which usually occurs during evening or night.

- Do not eat a heavy meal at lunch so that you do not feel drowsy or sleepy, 
  best would be to have a healthy diet with a mix of fibre and fresh vegetables 
  (high in nutrients) in order to be at your peak performance

- Theres a saying 'stay hungry and stay foolish'. The hungry in this context
  doesn't only point to the thirst for attaining knowledge but also another
  meaning that I discovered quite recently that I can relate to this is that 
  if we do intermediate fasting or keep an empty stomach it helps us to focus better
  on our work because according to our biology since ancient times our brain
  functions better when we need to search for food (empty stomach).
